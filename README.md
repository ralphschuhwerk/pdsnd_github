### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also worte a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### What Software Is Needed
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### Content Of The Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

### Statistics Computed

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time).
Popular stations and trip.
Trip duration.
User info.
